# ELMDuino_BLE
My attempt to get the ElmDuino library tow work with the ESP32-S3.
Im not a programmer, Im just a mechanical engineer :(

The code provided works with an ESP32-S3 module and connects to an OBDII BLE 4.0 reader.
Currently it only asks for the ELM327 version and posts it in the serial moniter and is unable to request for other engine telementary data.
